# NLP with Disaster Tweets using RNN Techniques
*A machine learning process* 

### Overview
Understanding human languages is a challenging task for computers because our language has many rules, words, and meanings. We are able to write or speak figuratively using descriptive words. In the online social media website *Twitter*, many people are able to announce disasters and emergencies faster and easier than the news outlets, law enforcement, and/or government communication sites. For this reason, it would be ideal if a computer could recognize those emergency posts and classify them such that disaster relief can come to aide and news agencies are able to spread the word faster. However, because humans often use words for multiple meanings, we need to be able to identify what tweets are real disasters or emergencies, and which are not. We will be using Recursive Neural Network (RNN) machine learning techniques to attempt to classify natual language text. For this project we will be evaluated on the F1 score, which is written in the competition description as $F1 = 2*\frac{precision*recall}{precision+recall}$ where $precision = \frac{TP}{TP+FP}$ and $recall=\frac{TP}{TP+FN}$.
